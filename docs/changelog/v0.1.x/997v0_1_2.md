### Fixed

#### xrpl

- The `InfoRequest` for the `account_info` method had an incorrect field `signer_list` (an `s` was missing). The correct field is now `signer_lists`.  
  Link to the documentation [here](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/public-api-methods/account-methods/account_info#request-format).
