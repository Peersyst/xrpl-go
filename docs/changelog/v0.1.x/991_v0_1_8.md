- Added `BalanceChanges` to the `Transaction` type.

### Changed

#### xrpl

- Updated `AffectedNode` type fields to be a pointer to allow nil values.
- Fixed `BaseLedger` field in `ledger` response (v1 and v2). BaseLedger.Transactions is now an array of interfaces instead of a slice of `FlatTransaction` due to `Expand` field in the request.
