### Added

#### xrpl

- Added `GatewayBalances` and `GetAggregatePrice` queries.

### Fixed

#### xrpl

- Updated SignerQuorum in SignerListSet to be an interface{} with uint32 type assertion instead of a value (uint32).
  - This allows distinguishing between an unset (nil) and an explicitly set value, including 0 to delete a signer list.
  - Ensures SignerQuorum is only included in the Flatten() output when explicitly defined.
  - Updates the `Validate` method to make sure `SignerEntries` is not set when `SignerQuorum` is set to 0
