# queries

## Overview

The `queries` package contains mainly request and response types for the [XRPL methods](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/public-api-methods). This package is used by the package clients `rpc` and `websocket` to send client queries to the ledger.

:::info

As a developer, you may be interested in calling the queries using the `websocket` or `rpc` clients. Both clients expose methods to call each query exposed by the `queries` package. 

:::

Queries are grouped by different categories or packages:

- `account`: Methods to work with account info.
- `channel`: Methods to work with channels.
- `ledger`: Methods to retrieve ledger info.
- `transaction`: Submit and query ledger transactions.
- `path`: Methods to use paths and order books.
- `nft`: Methods to work with NFTs.
- `oracle`: Methods to work with oracles.
- `clio`: Methods to use the Clio API, not `rippled`.
- `server`: Methods to retrieve information about the current state of the rippled server.
- `utility`: Perform convenient tasks, such as ping and random number generation.


### API version

By default, all queries are meant to be used with the latest XRPL API version (currently `v2`). If you want to use a specific version, you will need to import the specific version queries package from each subpackage.

For example, if you want to use the XRPL API version `v1` queries of the `account` subpackage, you will need to import it this way:
```go
import accountv1 "github.com/Peersyst/xrpl-go/xrpl/queries/account/v1"
```
