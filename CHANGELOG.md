  - Payment
  - DepositPreauth
  - AccountDelete
  - PaymentChannelClaim
  - EscrowFinish
- Added the `credential` ledger entry for the `account_objects` request.
- Added tec/tef/tel/tem/ter TxResult codes.
- Replaced string declaration with constant/object references.

## Fixed

### binary-codec

- Added native `uint8` type support for `Uint8` type.

### big-decimal

- Fixed `BigDecimal` precision.

## [v0.1.9]

### Added

#### xrpl

- Added support for all the Credential transaction types:
  - CredentialCreate
  - CredentialAccept
  - CredentialDelete

### Fixed

#### big-decimal

- Amounts transcoding fix for large values.

## [v0.1.8]

### Added

#### xrpl

- Added `BalanceChanges` to the `Transaction` type.

### Changed

#### xrpl

- Updated `AffectedNode` type fields to be a pointer to allow nil values.
- Fixed `BaseLedger` field in `ledger` response (v1 and v2). BaseLedger.Transactions is now an array of interfaces instead of a slice of `FlatTransaction` due to `Expand` field in the request.

## [v0.1.7]

### Added

#### xrpl

- Added support for websocket client subscriptions. Now you can subscribe to streams like `ledgerClosed`, `transaction`, `consensus`, `peerStatusChange`, `validationReceived`, etc.

## [v0.1.6]

### Added

#### xrpl

- Configurable timeout for the RPC client. New default timeout of 5 seconds instead of 1 second.

### Fixed

#### xrpl

- Updates some fields in AccountSet and Payment related transactions to a pointer to allow 0 or "" values. For example:

  - `DestinationTag`
  - `TickSize`
  - `Domain`
  - `WalletLocator`
  - `WalletSize`
  - `TransferRate`

- Adds more tests for setting some `asf` flags in `AccountSet`.
- Fixed `Transaction` field in `account_tx` response.
- Fixed `Ledger` field in `ledger` response. LedgerIndex is now an uint32 instead of a string.

## [v0.1.5]

### Added

#### xrpl

Support for the XLS-77d (deep freeze)

## [v0.1.4]

### Added

#### xrpl

- Added `GatewayBalances` and `GetAggregatePrice` queries.

### Fixed

#### xrpl

- Updated SignerQuorum in SignerListSet to be an interface{} with uint32 type assertion instead of a value (uint32).
  - This allows distinguishing between an unset (nil) and an explicitly set value, including 0 to delete a signer list.
  - Ensures SignerQuorum is only included in the Flatten() output when explicitly defined.
  - Updates the `Validate` method to make sure `SignerEntries` is not set when `SignerQuorum` is set to 0

## [v0.1.3]

###Â Added

- Added `APIVersion` field to the `Client` struct.
- Added `RippledAPIV1` and `RippledAPIV2` constants.
- Added missing `ctid` field on `TxRequest` v1 query.
- Added missing `NoRippleCheck` query (v1 & v2 support).

### Changed

- RippledAPIV2 is set as default API version. Queries and transactions are now compatible with Rippled v2 by default. V1 is still supported. In order to use v1, you need to use the `v1` package of each query type.

## [v0.1.2]

### Fixed

#### xrpl

- The `InfoRequest` for the `account_info` method had an incorrect field `signer_list` (an `s` was missing). The correct field is now `signer_lists`.  
  Link to the documentation [here](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/public-api-methods/account-methods/account_info#request-format).
